IUCAAplex is a media platform for friends who have been working hard, and can surely use a break 🍻
This is a voluntary project, hosting free and open content 👼🏽
#    
- 'web' contains all the modifications made to the Jellyfin system files.
- .bak file/ folders the original Jellyfin content.

    ```        
    Location:
    /usr/share/jellyfin/web
    ```
- `changetitle.sh` is used to change the page title. Run this at `/usr/share/jellyfin/web` on the server.
